## A project management and inspiration app for fiber artists

The Sewcialist Agenda allows users to create track and manage their creative projects. Users can add a new project, including a title and description, and a start and end date. Once created, users can view a project, add photo, add and change materials and tasks, and generally update the project based on ther needs. Creating a task adds it to the visual timeline at the top of the profile page, while changing the start and end dates of the project will automatically update the lenght of the bar associated with that task, showing how many days have been allocated for a specific task.
